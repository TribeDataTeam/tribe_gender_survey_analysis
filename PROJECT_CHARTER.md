Strengthening Gender diversity and Inclusion in Tribe Tampere
Introduction
Gender diversity and inclusion in entrepreneurship and related activities is a global concept that transcends borders and industries, geared towards creating a more equitable and innovative entrepreneurial landscape. Despite the reported social and economic benefits of women’s entrepreneurial activity globally, entrepreneurship continues to remain a male-dominated phenomena (Hughes et al. 2012). 
Addressing existing gender disparities, biases and barriers that may hinder an all-inclusive entrepreneurial landscape is imperative for driving continuous innovation, economic growth, and social progress. By promoting gender diversity, organizations and societies can harness the full potential of diverse perspectives and talents, leading to more creative solutions, better decision-making, and a more vibrant and sustainable entrepreneurial community.
Problem
Over the years, several policies, programs, and initiatives aimed at promoting gender diversity and supporting the inclusion and advancement of all genders have been put in place, yet the European economic report on female participation in entrepreneurship highlights the gender gap in entrepreneurship in Europe, where men are more likely to start and oversee new businesses than women. The report emphasizes the importance of supporting female entrepreneurship for a more inclusive and sustainable future. Socioeconomic and individual factors, such as government support, cultural approval, obtaining finance, networking, training & education, and fear of failure, influence female entrepreneurial activity in Europe. GEM 2023 reports “there is a significant gender gap in established business ownership, defined as managing a running business for more than 42 months”. Right now, global figures reveal that only 37% of business are owned by women, with a great majority of them from middle- and low-income countries.
Recent data on women's participation in entrepreneurship in Finland indicates that there are still barriers to pursuing entrepreneurship, despite the country's reputation for gender equality. The GEM Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report for Finland highlights lower rates of female participation in entrepreneurship and related activities, suggesting more subtle, cultural barriers that policymakers should address. According to reports, female entrepreneurs in Finland still face gender barriers, including internal and external factors. Internal barriers include self-doubt, fear of failure, and imposter syndrome, while external barriers encompass societal expectations, gender stereotypes, and limited access to funding and networks. The Nordic countries, including Finland, are viewed as forerunners on gender equality and women's labor force participation. However, there are far fewer women than men starting businesses in the Nordics. The study "Female Entrepreneurship in the Nordics 2020" identifies several challenges for women entrepreneurs, such as less access to role models and smaller networks, male-dominated entrepreneurial culture, and limited access to external funding. 
The way forward
As part of concerted efforts to provide a collaborative ecosystem aimed at grooming startups, Tribe Tampere was conceived. It serves the entire Tampere startup ecosystem by uniting startups, talents, and organizations to act and build a thriving startup community – together! 
What gender diversity and inclusion means for Tribe Tampere.
As part of its charter and very reason for existence “creating a sustainable environment to foster continuous growth, development and expansion of start-ups”, Tribe Tampere is looking to create a balanced atmosphere that fosters growth and success of entrepreneurs and their business alike. This commitment extends to promoting all-round inclusiveness and ensuring equal access to opportunities such as mentorship, networking, and visibility, regardless of gender, race, or color. Thus, breaking all systemic and non-systemic barriers put in place to put individual or group of individuals, ahead of others.
In a nutshell, at Tribe Tampere gender diversity means:
Inclusiveness: Equal opportunities for all gender, race, and color
Idea to innovation: We value and welcome every idea and are ready to provide opportunities and platforms for nurturing them.
Teamwork: we believe in the concept of shared success hence we don’t just talk the talk; we walk the walk with you. 
Motivation: The journey won’t be a smooth ride, as your jolly fellow, we are here to support and celebrate you every step of the way
Since its inception in 2017, Tribe Tampere has devised several strategies to grow the startup ecosystem. It has organized events, programs and initiatives not limited to mentorship sessions, community partnerships, fellowships etc. to ensure aspiring entrepreneurs irrespective race, color gender, have equal access to growth, networks, and opportunities. Despite these efforts there seems to be low participation of females in her activities. It is to this end that Tribe Tampere seeks to devise new strategies to solve this problem thus increasing inclusivity and overall female participation in entrepreneurship activities.
